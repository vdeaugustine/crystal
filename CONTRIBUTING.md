# Contributing to Crystal

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Crystal! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to work with you.

Crystal is an open source project created by [Stravu](https://stravu.com/).  Stravu is the way AI-first teams collaborate.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   pnpm run setup
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Process

### Running in Development

```bash
# Run the Electron app in development mode
pnpm run electron-dev

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint
```

### Code Style

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Code is formatted with Prettier (runs automatically on commit)
- ESLint is used for code quality
- Follow the existing code style and patterns

## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. Ensure your branch is up to date with main

### Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues when applicable (#123)
- Keep commits focused and atomic

Example:
```
Add session status indicators

- Add color-coded badges for session states
- Include animation for running state
- Update types for new status field

Fixes #42
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation if needed
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Update the README if adding new features
5. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes

## Testing

### Current Status
Crystal doesn't have automated tests yet - we welcome contributions to add them! If you'd like to help set up a testing framework, please open an issue to discuss the approach.

### Manual Testing Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Always test your changes in the packaged DMG before submitting a PR. The packaged app often reveals issues that don't appear in development mode.

```bash
# Build the macOS DMG
pnpm build:mac

# Test the DMG located in dist-electron/
```

Manual testing checklist:
- [ ] Create new session
- [ ] Continue existing session
- [ ] Git operations work correctly
- [ ] Run scripts execute properly
- [ ] UI is responsive
- [ ] Settings persist after restart
- [ ] Notifications work (if enabled)
- [ ] **DMG build works correctly** ⚠️
